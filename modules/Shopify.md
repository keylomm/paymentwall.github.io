# Shopify

Paymentwall has partnered with Shopify to allow its server owners accept payments easily via Paymentwall using credit cards, SMS payments, prepaid payment methods (such as Paysafecard, TicketSurf, Boleto), bank transfers and eWallets.

To connect Paymentwall with your Shopify store simply follow the 2 easy steps below:

## Project configuration in Paymentwall system
* Create your project with [Shopify connect button](https://api.paymentwall.com/developers/connect?source=shopify).

* You will be taken to **Paymentwall Account Registration Page**. **Sign Up** if you don't have an account or **Sign In** if you already have one. When you **Sign Up**, use your Shopify webstore URL for the **Website URL** field (e.g. *https://mystore.myshopify.net*).

* You will be taken to your merchant area page with your project already set up (a new project will be created if you had an account before).

* Go to **My Projects** tab. You will see that your new project has already been created. **Project Key** and **Secret Key** will be needed later to finish the project setup on Shopify admin panel.

* In **Settings** section, please set **Your API type** to  **Digital Goods**.

* Turn on the **Widget signature is required**.

* Change the **Pingback URL** to your Shopify store URL (e.g. *https://mystore.myshopify.net*)

* Choose the **Pingback Signature Version** to version 3.

  > Remember to save changes at the bottom of **Settings** section.
