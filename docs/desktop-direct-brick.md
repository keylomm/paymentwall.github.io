Brick is a pure credit card payment solution provided by Paymentwall. It allows you to develop your own payment experience for credit cards payments specifically.

It can be used in [Paylet](/paylet-home) as credit card gateway. Alternatively, you can integrate it using [Brick API](/apis#section-brick-onetime_token) in your application. 

## Try with Brick

By using Brick test cards in [Sanbox](/direct/brick/sandbox) or card information below to do a test payment.

* Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242.

* Expiry date: 03/21.

* CVV: 097.

* Email: test@paymentwall.com.

Each successful payment has a one-time token to be used in further charge request.

## Components

* [Create form](/direct/brick/create-form) to collect payment details and generate one-time token. 

* Perform request according to your product type, [onetime payment](/direct/brick/charge) or [subscription](/direct/brick/subscription).

## Requirements

* Your payment pages must be loaded via **HTTPS**.

* [3D Secure](http://www.mastercard.com/gateway/implementation_guides/3D-Secure.html) (as known as [verified by Visa](https://www.visaeurope.com/making-payments/verified-by-visa/)) should be implemented into your payment system. See how to [apply 3D Secure](/direct/brick/3dSecure) in Brick.

* A Paymentwall project with Digital Goods API enabled.
