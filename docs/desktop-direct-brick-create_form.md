# Create Form

This tutorial helps you to create a form to collect payment details and generate one-time token. by using Brick.js. 

See [one-time token API](/apis#section-brick-onetime_token) as an alternative way to obtain one-time token.

You can choose either using Brick [default form](#tokenize-payment-details-with-default-form) or creating your [own form](#tokenize-payment-details-with-your-own-form) on your front end to get following parameters:

* One-time token

A generated 34 bit string started with ```o_```, eg: ```o_6da4e28d335c627003242fdd0a03a1d2```. For sandbox environment, it starts with ```ot_``` in sandbox environment, eg: ```ot_ccd2d68ef06d9c0e485d62b7039a6f64```. 

> One-time token is only valid for 5 mins.

* Fingerprint

A 32 bit string generated by Brick.js for payment risk purpose, eg: ```slZbOOhPlyDQKkoyYBkKdJ7dpDslaCer```.

These two parameters should be sent to your backend to perform charging requeset.

### Tokenize payment details with default form
Paymentwall provides you a default form for Brick to collect payment details.
To implement it, our secure file - Brick.js, needs to be included in your page.
```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://api.paymentwall.com/brick/brick.1.4.js"></script>
```
Create a div with id, please keep the consistency with the value of ```container``` in separate script tag.  
```html
  <div id="payment-form-container"></div>
```
This tutorial uses a test project key which is also available to test in the section below. Please replace the value of param ```publick_key``` with your own Brick project key.
```html
  <script src="https://api.paymentwall.com/brick/brick.1.4.js"> </script>
  <div id="payment-form-container"> </div>
  <script>
    var brick = new Brick({
      public_key: 't_365891948ea844de751301cbcc1897', // please update it to Brick live key before launch your project
      amount: 9.99,
      currency: 'USD',
      container: 'payment-form-container',
      action: '/YOUR-CHARGE-ACTION',
      form: {
        merchant: 'Paymentwall',
        product: 'Gold Membership',
        pay_button: 'Pay',
        zip: true
      }
    });

    brick.showPaymentForm(function(data) {
      // handle success
    }, function(errors) {
      // handle errors
    });
  </script>
```
Brick object would help you to collect payment details, fingerprint and tokenize them automatically.  Every value of param can be adjusted to satisfy your own needs.


### Tokenize payment details with your own form
To build your own payment form with Brick.js, we assume that you have the basic knowledge of HTML as well as a payment form to collect payment details as below.

```html
  <form id="brick-creditcard-form" action="billing.php" method="POST">
    <input name="custom_parameter" type="hidden" value="custom_value"/>
    <div>
      <label>
        <span>Card number</span>
        <input data-brick="card-number" type="text" id="card-number"/>
      </label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>
        <span>Card expiration</span>
        <input data-brick="card-expiration-month" type="text" size="2" id="card-exp-month"/> /
        <input data-brick="card-expiration-year" type="text" size="4" id="card-exp-year"/>
      </label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>
        <span>Card CVV</span>
        <input data-brick="card-cvv" type="text" id="card-cvv"/>
      </label>
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
```
Including Brick.js to implement tokenization, in which way you don't need to tokenize the credit card details on your own. It can  be loaded directly from https://api.paymentwall.com/brick/
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://api.paymentwall.com/brick/brick.1.4.js"></script>
```
The next step is to create a new script tag to declare Brick object and set API credentials with the Brick keys which can be found in [project section]().

> We are using [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) in this tutorial

```html
  <script>
    var $form = $('#brick-creditcard-form');
    var brick = new Brick({
      public_key: 't_365891948ea844de751301cbcc1897', // please update it to Brick live key before launch your project
      form: { formatter: true }
    }, 'custom');
  </script>
```
In order to implement tokenization and send information to your server, a script should be added to collect payment details after the code above.  
```javascript
  $form.submit(function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    $form.find('button').prop('disabled', true); // prevent repeat click

    brick.tokenizeCard({ // Tokenize payment details
      card_number: $('#card-number').val(),
      card_expiration_month: $('#card-exp-month').val(),
      card_expiration_year: $('#card-exp-year').val(),
      card_cvv: $('#card-cvv').val()
    }, function(response) {
      if (response.type == 'Error') { // faile to create token
        // handle errors
      } else { // token created successfully
        $form.append($('<input type="hidden" name="brick_token"/>').val(response.token));
        $form.append($('<input type="hidden" name="brick_fingerprint"/>').val(Brick.getFingerprint()));
        $form.get(0).submit(); // submit token and fingerprint to your server
      }
    });

    return false;
  });
```
